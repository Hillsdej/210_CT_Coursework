//Question 1
// research: https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-algorithm-to-find-the-nearest-square-of-a-given-number
// A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as a product of two equal integers
// Take the root of the number
// round it down to an integer (floor_int) and then add 1 (ceil_int)
// square both integers
// calculate which square is the closest to the original number and return it.

PERFECT-SQUARE(NUM):
    lower_root_num <- squareroot(NUM)
    lower_root_num <- int(lower_root_num)
    upper_root_num <- lower_root + 1
    lower_square <- lower_root_num * lower_root_num
    upper_square <- upper_root_num * upper_root_num
    
    if lower_root = NUM:
        return lower_root
    else:
        return upper_root
